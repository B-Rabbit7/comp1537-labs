    <p>Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is a major Canadian city along Lake Ontario’s northwestern
        shore. It's a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN
        Tower. Toronto also has many green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queen’s Park to 400-acre High Park and its
        trails, sports facilities and zoo</p>
